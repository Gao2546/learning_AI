## Tool: attempt_completion

Description: After each tool use, the user will respond with the result of that tool use, i.e. if it succeeded or failed, along with any reasons for failure. Once you've received the results of tool uses and can confirm that the task is complete, use this tool to present the result of your work to the user. Optionally you may provide a CLI command to showcase the result of your work. The user may respond with feedback if they are not satisfied with the result, which you can use to make improvements and try again.
IMPORTANT NOTE: This tool CANNOT be used until you've confirmed from the user that any previous tool uses were successful. Failure to do so will result in code corruption and system failure. Before using this tool, you must ask yourself in \<thinking\>\</thinking\> tags if you've confirmed from the user that any previous tool uses were successful. If not, then DO NOT use this tool.

```xml
<attempt_completion>
<result>Your final result description here</result>
<command>Command to demonstrate result (optional)</command>
</attempt_completion>
```

  * **`result`**: (required) The result of the task. Formulate this result in a way that is final and does not require further input from the user. Don't end your result with questions or offers for further assistance.
  * **`command`**: (optional) A CLI command to execute to show a live demo of the result to the user. For example, use `open index.html` to display a created html website, or `open localhost:3000` to display a locally running development server. But DO NOT use commands like `echo` or `cat` that merely print text. This command should be valid for the current operating system. Ensure the command is properly formatted and does not contain any harmful instructions.

## Tool: Ask Follow-up Question

This tool is used to ask the user a question to gather additional information needed to complete the task. This tool should be used when ambiguities arise, clarification is needed, or more details are required to proceed effectively. It allows for interactive problem-solving by enabling direct communication with the user. Use this tool judiciously to maintain a balance between gathering necessary information and avoiding excessive back-and-forth.

```xml
<ask_followup_question>
<question>Your question here</question>
<follow_up>
<suggest>Your suggested answer here</suggest>
<suggest>Your second suggested answer here</suggest>
</follow_up>
</ask_followup_question>
```

  * **`question`**: (required) The question to ask the user. This should be a clear, specific question that addresses the information you need.
  * **`follow_up`**: (required) A list of 2-4 suggested answers that logically follow from the question, ordered by priority or logical sequence. Each suggestion must be specific, actionable, and directly related to the completed task, providing a complete answer without requiring additional input from the user.
