      "3. **Blue light is scattered more**: The blue light is scattered in all directions because it has a shorter wavelength and is more easily deflected by the small gas molecules. This is known as Rayleigh scattering.\n",
      "4. **Red light continues straight**: The longer wavelength red light, on the other hand, travels in a more direct path through the atmosphere, reaching our eyes from a more oblique angle.\n",

      "It's worth noting that:\n",
      "\n",
      "* During sunrise and sunset, the sky can appear red or orange due to a different scattering effect called Mie scattering.\n",
      "* At high altitudes, the sky can appear more intense blue because there are fewer atmospheric molecules to scatter the light.\n",

      "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a type of conversational AI model that combines retrieval mechanisms with generation capabilities. It was first introduced in the paper \"Re-Ranking of Retrieved Documents for Conversational AI\" by Raghav Gupta et al.\n",
      "\n",
      "In traditional conversational AI models, the goal is to generate text based on user input, such as answering questions or completing tasks. However, this approach can lead to incomplete or inaccurate responses if the model cannot fully understand the context or intent behind the user's query.\n",
      "\n",
      "RAG addresses this limitation by introducing a retrieval component that searches for relevant documents or knowledge graphs related to the user's input. The retrieved documents are then used as inputs to generate text that is more accurate, complete, and contextually relevant.\n",
      "\n",
      "The RAG architecture typically consists of three main components:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Retriever**: This module searches for relevant documents or knowledge graphs based on the user's input.\n",
      "2. **Ranker**: This module evaluates the retrieved documents and ranks them in order of relevance to the user's query.\n",
      "3. **Generator**: This module uses the top-ranked document(s) as inputs to generate text that is more accurate, complete, and contextually relevant.\n",
      "\n",
      "The retrieval mechanism is typically based on a search engine or a knowledge graph, while the generation component can be based on a variety of models, such as language models (e.g., transformer-based models) or sequence-to-sequence models.\n",
      "\n",
      "RAG has several advantages over traditional conversational AI models, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Improved accuracy: By using retrieved documents as inputs to generate text, RAG models can produce more accurate and complete responses.\n",
      "* Contextual understanding: The retrieval component helps to better understand the context and intent behind the user's query, leading to more relevant and accurate responses.\n",
      "* Reduced training data: RAG models require less training data than traditional conversational AI models, as the retrieval mechanism can learn to recognize patterns in language from a smaller dataset.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, RAG also has some limitations and challenges, such as:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Retrieval quality: The quality of the retrieved documents can significantly impact the performance of the RAG model.\n",
      "* Document ranking: The ranking of retrieved documents can be challenging, especially when there are multiple relevant documents with similar rankings.\n",
      "* Generation quality: While the retrieval component improves accuracy, the generation component may still struggle to produce high-quality text that is contextually relevant and accurate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, RAG has shown promising results in various conversational AI applications, such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and question-answering systems.\n"
