# **Web Page or Search Engine Query Instructions [mcp_BrowserBase]**

You can search for information on any web page or use the **DuckDuckGo** search engine. Follow these steps:  

---

## **Method 1: Searching on a Specific Web Page** (use top search)

1. **Retrieve the Web Page**  
   - If you have not yet loaded the web page, use the `get_page` command.  
   - If user do not spacific web page, you must use **DuckDuckGo** but if user want to use other web page (ex. https://music.youtube.com https://www.w3schools.com https://www.bbc.com/ .etc) you must use that page to search for information 
   - If you use **DuckDuckGo** you must be getting the link of serach resul and get the page for that link

2. **Retrieve the Page Source Or Text**  
   - If the page source (html MarkUp) has not been retrieved, use the `get_source` command to extract and save it to **RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).  
   - If the page text (information on page) has not been retrieved, use the `get_text` command to extract and save it to **RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).
   - this steps is only get data from page and save it to **RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). if you wnat to get data you need to call `get_SourceOrText_from_rag`

3. **Extract the Search Box Identifier**  
   - If you have already retrieved the page source, use the `get_SourceOrText_from_rag` command to fetch the stored source.  
   - ex. prompt : [Find button elements with aria-label containing 'Play' or 'เล่น' , Find the input element with placeholder 'Search']
   - Locate the **ID name** or **Class name** of the search box.
   - Before calling 'Search_By_idOrClass' you must be using this step
   - Use this step to find resources have been retrieved from data you want after this step you must get data from this step analysis it.
   - You can use this step only find data you want
   - If you want to find search box try to find placeholder : [search , ค้นหาสินค้า , ค้นหา , keywords , คำค้นหา ,.etc] tags : [input , div]
   - Search Strategy:
    Look for tags: input, div (extendable to textarea, span if necessary).
    Check placeholder or text content for keywords such as:
        "search", "ค้นหาสินค้า", "ค้นหา", "keywords", "คำค้นหา"
        (include partial matches and case-insensitive checks).
    Prefer elements of type input[type="text"], input[type="search"], input[type="keyword"].
    Fallback to elements that contain matching keywords as aria-label, label, id, or name.
    Ignore elements that are visually hidden (e.g., display: none, aria-hidden="true", or off-screen).
   - prompt to find resources have been retrieved from data you want and select top k search results related to the query. (use 5 for find links you can increate top k search results if you want more information , use 5 for find search box , you can increate top k search results if you want more information and use 5 for find text you can increate top k search results if you want more information , use 20 for find elements you want to click on top k search results you can increate top k search results if you want more information)
   - If you can not find some element or information you want try to increate top k value. and try to change to another key word 
   <!-- - If you can not find some element or information you can try searching steps by steps for more information to search in next step. in finally you prompt is enough spacific information for search element you want to find. -->
   <!-- (remove spacifice key word) --> 
   <!-- - If you cannot find a specific element or information on a webpage, follow these steps:
    Attempt Initial Extraction: Try to locate the required element or information directly from the current webpage.
    Use RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):
        If the element is not found, initiate a step-by-step RAG process to gather more context.
        In each step, use the information retrieved to refine your understanding and improve the search strategy.
    Iterative Refinement:
        Continue using the RAG process iteratively until you gather enough precise context.
        Use each piece of new information to formulate a more specific query or extraction strategy.
    Final Step:
        Once you have sufficient, specific information, perform a final search to extract the desired element from the web page accurately. -->
   - You are an intelligent web agent using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to locate specific elements on a webpage. Your task is to find the most relevant element by analyzing the structure of the page. When searching:
   Start from parent elements and navigate down to children to locate the desired item if needed.
   If the page contains many elements, use contextual information by calling get_text() on sections of the page to extract useful clues.
   Use the retrieved text to narrow down your search, infer meaning, and better locate the correct element.
   Accuracy is key: choose the most semantically and structurally appropriate element.

4. **Perform a Search on the Page**  
   - Once you have the **ID name** , **Class name** or **Tag Name** of the search box, use the `Search_By_idOrClass` command to search for your desired content. probperties format {Id : **ID name** , Class : **Class name** , TagName : **Tag name** , text : "text or keyword"} for each properties must be same element .
   - **Skip this step** if you do not need to perform a search.

## **Method 2: Searching via a Search Engine & Extracting Information** (use top search)

1. **Initiate a Search via DuckDuckGo**  
   - Use **Step 1** (`Search_By_DuckDuckGo`) to search web page using DuckDuckGo search engine.  
   - If you use **DuckDuckGo** you must be getting the link of serach resul and get the page for that link
   - If user do not spacific web page, you must use **DuckDuckGo** but if user want to use other web page (ex. https://music.youtube.com https://www.w3schools.com https://www.bbc.com/ .etc) you must use that page to search for information 

2. **Retrieve the Search Results Source**  
   - Use **Step 2** (`get_source`) to extract the page source ((html MarkUp)).  
   - Use **Step 2** (`get_text`) to extract the page text (information on page).
   - this steps is only get data from page and save it to **RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). if you wnat to get data you need to call `get_SourceOrText_from_rag`

3. **Extract Relevant Links from Search Results**  
   - Use **Step 3** (`get_SourceOrText_from_rag`) to find and select the **Nth** link of interest, use prompt about data you want to find. 
   - ex. prompt : [Find button elements with aria-label containing 'Play' or 'เล่น' , Find the input element with placeholder 'Search' , Find the link (a tag) containing the text 'ขอให้โชคเลว (Good luck, not!)']
   - If you do not need HTML tags, ignore them after this step.  
   - Use this step to find resources have been retrieved from data you want after this step you must get data from this step analysis it.
   - You can use this step only find data you want
   - prompt to find resources have been retrieved from data you want and select top k search results related to the query. (use 5 for find links you can increate top k search results if you want more information , use 5 for find search box , you can increate top k search results if you want more information and use 5 for find text you can increate top k search results if you want more information , use 5 for find elements you want to click on top k search results you can increate top k search results if you want more information)
   - If you can not find some element or information you can try to increate top k value. and try to change to another key word 
   <!-- - If you can not find some element or information you can try searching steps by steps for more information to search in next step. in finally you prompt is enough spacific information for search element you want to find. -->
   <!-- (remove spacifice key word) -->

   Accuracy is key: choose the most semantically and structurally appropriate element.

4. **Retrieve and Search the Selected Page**  
   - Use **Step 1** again to load the selected page.  
   - If needed, follow **Method 1** to search within the page.

## **Additional Notes**  
- If searching within web pages from search engine results, **combine** both **Method 1** and **Method 2** as necessary.  
- Ask user every time to use this tool
- If information about questions not enough you can search more information about questions. using **Method 1** and **Method 2**
- If user do not need to use this tool. you can answer user questions using your knowledge
- If you want to clicked on page to perform tasks to finish (if you do not want put some text in this task to search someting) use this tool `click_on_page` to finish current tasks or step. probperties format {Id : `id name` , Class : `class name` , TagName : `tag name`} for each properties must be same element . if not value pass empty string . but you want to search some things you must use **Method 1** and **Method 2** and put text to search you must use this tool `Search_By_idOrClass`
- If you can not find some element or information you want try to increate top k value. and try to change to another key word (remove spacifice key word) 
<!-- - **Class name** can be used to **CSS_SELECTOR** (ex.from class = "style-scope ytmusic-card-shelf-renderer" use this {"IdOrClass": ".style-scope.ytmusic-card-shelf-renderer"}) -->
- If element not changed in page do not repeat get resource of page.
- If you not sure in each step you must ask user.
- Before task complete please check the result. If result is not complete please find other way to finish
- you must use `get_text` if you want to find infomation on page.
